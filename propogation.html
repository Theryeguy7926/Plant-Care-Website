            <h1>Propogation</h1>
            <p>Cuttings is the most common indoors plants propagation method. Some plants which can be propagated with
                this method can be very hard to do “without the correct equipment and conditions”, while others are very
                easy and can even be started in water (soil is best though).</p>
                <div id="propogation"></div>
            <h2>Stem Cuttings</h2>
            <p>This process is the most common of all. Stems and side stems are the main sections of the parent plant
                which produce further growth for leaves or flowers, that can be cut if they’re producing growth, but not
                when they’re flowering.<br><br>
                Take the cutting with a very sharp knife or blade below the node (leaf joint), which can be anything
                from 3in – 5in long and remove the lower leaves (so a few are left at the top of the stem). All you need
                to do now is dip the bottom inch of the stem in rooting hormone and place it in a hole you would have
                made deep and wide enough (you can use a pencil) to place a couple of inches of the new stem inside (use
                cutting soil). Propagating during spring and summer will improve your chance of success.</p>
            <h2>Leaf Cuttings</h2>
            <p>Many plant types without a main stem can follow the leaf cutting method. There are three ways of
                propagating a plant with leaf cuttings, which is a leaf cut with an inch or two of petiole (shoot with
                leaves), just the leaf or a section of a leaf cut.
                <br><br>
                The most common way is to take a whole leaf with a petiole. All three methods have a similar process
                depending on the type of plant. Many succulents and cacti are propagated with just a leaf because there
                is only a crown of leaves and no woody type stems. Peperomias and saintpaulias are propagated with a
                leaf and shoot, and then streptocarpus and sansevieria with a leaf section cutting. Follow the
                propagating method advised that’s specific for each plant, as mentioned in the guides on this site.
            </p>
            <h2>Root Cuttings</h2>
            <p>Taking a root cutting involves removing a decent size root section and then cutting the section into 2 –
                4 inch segments. It’s probably best to plant up to 5 or more root cuttings to improve the chances of
                success. Make sure the end of the root which was closest to the top (crown) of the plant and soil is
                placed just below the surface, which will produce the new shoots. Root cuttings are usually taken during
                the winter (dormant period), ready for the new growth to appear in spring for the new and parent plant.
            </p>
            <h2>Cane Cuttings</h2>
            <p>Some plants can be propagated by taking cane cuttings, such as cordyline, dieffenbachia and some
                dracaenas. This process involves taking a stem and cutting it into 3in long sections. These sections
                should at-least have one node or even better a bud that’s appeared, which is where the new shoot will
                sprout from and then roots should grow underneath the cane. The cuttings are placed on top of the soil
                horizontally and pushed half way into the soil, although some growers stand the cane upright.</p>
                <div id="propogation2"></div>
            <h2>Repotting</h2>
            <p>Once you know the foliage from the cutting has started to grow well enough (new growth on stem tips or
                plantlets for leaf cuttings), it’s time for it to be placed in it’s new pot which should be around 2 – 4
                inches wide. With leaf cuttings the parent leaf will need to be removed from the plantlet before
                re-potting.</p>
            <h2>Soil</h2>
            <p>I find it’s easy to buy and use ready made seed and potting compost, which is sold in most gardening
                stores. It’s good practice to add a thin layer of sharp sand to the top of the compost for many
                succulents and cactus plants.</p>
