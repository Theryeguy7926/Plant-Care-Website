            <h1>Watering</h1>
            <p>Regardless of the type of plants that you have in your home, watering house plants the correct way will
                determine the plant’s overall health and life span. Every type of plant has its own unique watering
                requirements. What works for one plant species may very well kill another member of your indoor plants
                garden.</p>
            <div id="watering"></div>
            <h2>Watering Various Plant Types</h2>
            <p>Regardless of the specific name of your indoor plant, it falls into one of a few very basic categories.
                The category of a plant can give you a good idea of how to approach the watering process.</p>
            <dt><u>Foliage</u> <i>(Plants that you purchase simply for the appearance of the leaves)</i></dt>
            <dl>As a general rule, these house plants should be watered directly on the soil, near where the root balls
                would be located. Water foliage types thoroughly during the growing season from spring – fall and much
                less during winter. During winter allow a period of time when the top inch is allowed to become dry
                before watering again – which allows the plant it’s rest period</dl>
            <dt><u>Flowering</u> <i>(Those that you purchase for the sake of enjoying the flowers they will bloom)</i>
            </dt>
            <dl>The soil for the majority of flowering house plants should be kept moist, but not wet all the times.
            </dl>
            <dt><u>Succulent and cacti</u> <i>(Plants that have adapted to life in a dry climate)</i> </dt>
            <dl>Regardless of whether these plants are used to living in dry climates or not, you still have to water
                them. From spring until fall I would suggest you water these so the soil is between moist and dry, then
                during the winter barely water them at all. Succulents and desert cacti store water for months in their
                foliage, so they need to be treated differently than other foliage and flowering plants.</dl>
            <h2>Frequency of Watering</h2>
            <p>How often should you water your plants? The answer to this is a complicated analysis that depends on
                several factors. Each plant’s unique needs will change throughout the year.</p>
            <dt><u>Environment</u></dt>
            <dl>Watering house plants of some varieties will depend on the environment they are in. Those in sunny
                windows will require watering more often than those in dark corners of office buildings.</dl>
            <dt><u>Time of Year</u></dt>
            <dl>Plants often need less water during the winter and more during the times when they are blooming and
                growing. Adjust your watering accordingly to prevent root rot.</dl>
            <dt><u>Species</u></dt>
            <dl>Different plant types will frequently need water at differing intervals. Plants that need watering only
                once a week should not be soaked every day, so pay attention to the species requirements.</dl>
            <h2>Signs of Under-Watering Or Over-Watering</h2>
            <p>Common signs of under-watering or over-watering on plants can tell you that the plant is going into
                shock. Look for these signs to know if you need to adjust the frequency of water that you are offering.
            </p>
            <dt><u>Dry Soil</u></dt>
            <dl>If the soil of the plant is so hard that you can’t feel moisture with your finger, then you need to
                water more often.</dl>
            <dt><u>Brown, Crisp Leaves</u></dt>
            <dl>Drying out like trees in the fall, plants often become crunchy and lose leaves when confronted with too
                little or too much water.</dl>
            <dt><u>Refusal to Bloom</u></dt>
            <dl>If a plant should be blooming, but isn’t, it probably isn’t getting the right amount of water.</dl>
            <dt><u>Drooping or Sagging</u></dt>
            <dl>Plants that don’t get the right amount of water often droop or sag.</dl>
            <dt><u>Soggy Soil</u></dt>
            <dl>Any time there is water standing under the plant or in the soil, the plant’s roots may well rot away.
                This should be avoided in order to keep the plant alive.</dl>
