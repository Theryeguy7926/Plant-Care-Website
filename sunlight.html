            <h1>Sunlight</h1>
            <p>The indoor plants lighting guide provides information about the light requirements needed for plants
                that’s vital for them to survive and grow well. Various conditions are essential factors which have to
                be provided for a house plants survival, including water, humidity, a suitable growing medium, correct
                temperatures and of course “light”.</p>
            <div id="sunlight"></div>
            <h2>Main Types of Natural Light Settings</h2>
            <dt><u>Bright Direct Sunlight</u></dt>
            <dl>Most house plants do not like full sun and many of them will become very damaged or will not survive
                very long when they receive too much direct sunlight. The only plants that enjoy summer sun is desert
                cacti, and succulents can tolerate a lot of sun (succulents seem to prefer some sun and bright
                conditions) . Full sun is experienced from a south facing window.</dl>
            <dt><u>Partial Sunlight and Shade</u></dt>
            <dl>For a plant to receive sun during the day for a couple of hours or so it will need to be seated close to
                a west or east facing window. Placed near a west or east facing window will give a plant some morning or
                evening sun; avoiding the heat of the midday sun. Many plants, especially flowering types grow at their
                best close to a window in partial sun and shade.</dl>
            <dt><u>Full Shade or Low Light</u></dt>
            <dl>Most plants do not grow at their best in shaded or low light conditions, especially flowering types.
                However, you’ll find some species survive and are known for their ability to thrive in low light and
                they’re easy to grow (good for beginner growers). A few plants come to mind that grow in low lighting
                well includes the cast iron plant, mother in laws tongue, dragon tree, zz plant and others which you can
                find in a collection here. A north facing window provides full shade, but low light can often depend on
                the size or amount of windows in a room.</dl>
            <dt><u>Bright Indirect Sunlight</u></dt>
            <dl>This is the lighting requirement for most foliage plants and many flowering types too. The best place
                for bright light without direct sun is a south facing window; with the plant set back a few feet from
                the window. East and west facing windows are also suitable if the window is large enough to allow plenty
                of daylight, with the plant sitting far enough back from the early midday sun arriving and early sunset.
            </dl>
            <h3>Here is a guide to help you identify what kind of sunlight the windows in your home give off:</h3>
            <table>
                <th>Bright/Direct</th>
                <th>Direct/Indirect</th>
                <th>Direction Window Faces</th>
                <tr>
                    <td>Bright</td>
                    <td>Direct</td>
                    <td>South, East, & West</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td></td>
                    <td>Indirect</td>
                    <td>South, East, & West</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Low</td>
                    <td>Direct</td>
                    <td>East & West</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td></td>
                    <td>Indirect</td>
                    <td>North, East and West</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h2>Identifying Problems</h2>
            <p>If a plant is not receiving enough light or too much direct sunlight there are tell tale signs to look
                out for. Here are the common problems caused by incorrect lighting.</p>
            <p>Not Enough:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flowers no blooming</li>
                <li>Weak, slow and spindly growth.</li>
                <li>Yellowing leaves which eventually fall.</li>
                <li>New leaves remain smaller than usual.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Too Much:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flowers shrivel up and die quickly.</li>
                <li>Leaves shrivelling up and drying.</li>
                <li>Leaves fade in colour.</li>
                <li>Drooping leaves.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Artificial Light</h2>
            <p>Some plants may need artificial lighting to be able to grow well indoors, but not that many. During the
                winter (in temperate climates) it can be pretty light-less all day and maybe only 7 hours daylight
                (never mind sunshine), so you may have to provide artificial lighting, especially for those that need up
                to 12 hours a day. Using artificial lighting is an ideal way to grow in a room without windows, and for
                propagating plants.
                <br><br>
                Using artificial lighting provides a grower with extra benefits of having certain flowering plants (like
                the African violet) in bloom during winter months. And, keeps foliage plants looking green and healthy.
                <br><br>
                Florescent lights are best used which can be affordable to buy, and available in different styles with
                tubing or spot lamps. The tubing lights have to be hung from the ceiling or a frame and will have a
                reflective background. Terrariums with lighting are a great option.
                <br><br>
                The cheapest option which is also suitable “if your just supplementing natural daylight for a few hours
                a day” is a compact florescent lamp, which are bulbs that can be used in any lamp you have (with the
                correct fitting), although a lamp with reflective background is best used.
                <br><br>
                Different spectrum’s (light radiation) or a combination of them are available for the type of plant or
                situation they’re growing in, which represents the changes from natural sunlight. Gro-lux florescent
                bulbs are specially designed for indoor growing and emit a mixture of blue and red light spectrum’s.
