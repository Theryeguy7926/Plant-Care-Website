            <h1>Beginner Plants</h1>
            <p>If you're looking to start a houseplant collection and haven't developed your green thumb yet, some
                plants are better than others. Houseplants for beginners are easy to grow and can generally withstand
                erratic watering, uneven or bad light, and fluctuating temperatures. They can thrive in dorm rooms,
                offices, and sometimes even dismal corners. Here are a few good plants for beginners</p>
            <div class="plant">

                <h2 class="purple">Snake Plant</h2>
                <p>The snake plant (also called mother-in-law tongue) is a type of succulent named for the structural,
                    slithery shape of its leaves. Native to dry, rocky habitats, it can go up to three weeks without a
                    drop of water. Just be sure to place yours near a bright, indirect window and away from any drafts
                    since it won't appreciate the cold. The snake plant is a great choice if you live in a smaller
                    space, as it doesn't grow too quickly. This means it also won't need to be transferred to a new pot
                    very often, which will save new plant parents some time and headaches.</p>

                <img src="pothos.jpg" alt="Pothos Plant" width="250px" height="250px" class="plant-left">
                <h2 class="right purple">Pothos Plant</h2>
                <p>My favorite beginner houseplant is the pothos because you can see it grow in real time! A vining
                    plant that can grow up to 20 feet long indoors, the pothos is also super forgiving and responsive.
                    Even after leaving hers at home unattended for weeks at a time, Doswell notes that it's bounced
                    back, saying, "that kind of forgiveness from a plant is unmatched." Give your golden pothos plenty
                    of light to bring out its yellow hues, and be sure to check it often for signs of pests since its
                    layered leaves are an appealing breeding ground for bugs.</p>

            <div class="plant">
                <img src="zz.png" alt="ZZ Plant" width="250px" height="250px" class="plant-right">
                <h2 class="purple">ZZ Plant</h2>
                <p>Ask any green thumb about plants that are nearly impossible to kill, and the ZZ is sure to make the
                    list. These plants may not be the most exciting to look at, but they're so easy to care for that it
                    really doesn't matter. "Hands down, a ZZ plant is my go-to recommendation for all beginners. It just
                    works for everyone– it's super low maintenance, survives in almost every room (even the lowest
                    light), and is aesthetically pleasing in any space," Blocker raves. It's also drought-resistant and
                    can go 2 to 4 weeks without water, making it a great pick for those who travel often. Just be sure
                    to make sure its pot has a drainage hole so any water you give it has a place to escape.</p>

            <div class="plant">
                <img src="spiderplant.png" alt="Spider Plant" width="250px" height="250px" class="plant-left"
                    id="spider">
                <h2 class="right purple">Spider Plant</h2>
                <p>A well-grown spider plant is a magnificent thing. The plant grows easily in baskets or atop columns
                    with long, slender, arching leaves. The variegated variety is by far the most common. Over time, a
                    mature plant will send out plantlets, or offsets, on long stems that form an impressive hanging
                    display. These plantlets can be easily repotted to create new specimens. Spider plants are not picky
                    about water, light, or temperature.</p>

                <img src="englishivy.jpg" alt="English Ivy" width="250px" height="250px" class="plant-right">
                <h2 class="purple">English Ivy</h2>
                <p>English ivy is popular to grow both indoors and outdoors for its evergreen, climbing vines. It can do
                    great in a hanging basket indoors, where its vines can trail over the sides. This plant doesn’t need
                    much light, and it can grow in a variety of soil types. Just make sure it’s never waterlogged. And
                    repot it every year or two if it’s cramped. </p>
