            <h1>Temperature</h1>
            <p>Most plants grown indoors are native to tropical or sub-tropical countries where conditions are
                considerably and consistently warmer than what most of our gardens experience. This makes the
                temperatures within certain rooms in our homes a perfect match for them to grow well.</p>
            <div id="temperature"></div>
            <p><b>Most plants:</b> You will find most house plants grow at their best between temperatures of 60 – 75°F
                (15 – 24°). Some (not many) need less and other’s need slightly more, but plants that grow well within
                this range are well suited for homes and offices (because many rooms are kept close to these
                temperatures, already).</p>
            <p><b>Humidity and misting:</b> When temperatures are above the recommended level for that plant – approx
                75°F (24°C) you can help improve humidity for your plant by spray misting the leaves. Some plants grow
                well in higher temperatures which are usually placed in humidity trays and are misted regularly.</p>
            <p><b>Temperature too high:</b> Above 75°F (24°) is too high for most plants indoors , although outdoors
                they’re fine. The main reason they are intolerant of higher temperatures indoors is because they don’t
                have the same conditions, such as air humidity and sun light which promotes growth without confining the
                heat.</p>
            <p><b>Too low:</b> This is much more of a problem than higher temperatures because it damages a plants
                growth significantly and causes plant death, especially when too much water is also provided.</p>
            <h2>Potential Problems to be Aware of</h2>
            <dt><u>Windowsills</u></dt>
            <dl>While window areas make a great place for plants to sit within summer because of the light and warmth
                supply – during the winter drafts can cause certain plants problems. You may want to bring your plant
                back a few inches or so, or draft proof the window.</dl>
            <dt><u>Quick temperature changes and prolonged periods of cold</u></dt>
            <dl>The majority of indoor plants can tolerate temperatures above and below what they prefer. However, the
                real problem that will cause plant growth issues is a sudden drop in temperature or prolonged periods of
                cold. Between 5 – 10 °F changes are tolerated, but above this your plant could be having problems.</dl>
            <dt><u>Drafts</u></dt>
            <dl>The temperature within a room can differ depending on what area of the room it’s measured, and how it is
                heated. Near doors and windows is an area that has drafts, which can affect some plants if is a bit of a
                chilly draft. If a plant starts to have problems and it’s near a drafty spot, find it a better spot to
                reside in.</dl>
