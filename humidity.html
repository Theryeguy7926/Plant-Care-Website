            <h1>Humidity</h1>
            <p>Fortunately, many house plants thrive in average humidity levels within a home – with little attention
                paid to improving the levels. However, certain plant species (especially those native to the tropics and
                sub-tropics) need higher humidity levels, while others such as cacti and succulents respond well to dry
                conditions.</p>

            <h2>Ideal Humidity Levels</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest problems plants encounter (regarding humidity) growing indoors is enduring weeks or
                months in a room with central heating or any other artificial means of heating.</p>
            <p>The good news is we can prevent or rectify humidity problems by knowing the plants care needs, and
                improving house plants humidity levels.</p>
            <p>The measurement used for humidity is what’s called relative humidity, which measures water vapor and a
                specific amount air relative to the number of water particles that could be in a certain amount of air.
            </p>
            <p>Relative humidity is used to help determine a comfortable level suitable for animals , humans and plants.
            </p>
            <dt><u>80%-90%</u></dt>
            <dl>This is tropical weather that were not likely to encounter in temperate regions. Plants growing in a greenhouse or glasshouse can reach above 80%. For some species its the best place for them to grow.</dl>
            <dt><u>60%-80%</u></dt>
            <dl>This is the ideal level which is difficult to maintain indoors, especially for tropical plants. If a plant is sensitive to lower levels than 70%, increasing the humidity will be required.</dl>
            <dt><u>60%-40%</u></dt>
            <dl>You’ll find most homes are about this level during the summer which the majority of plants thrive in. Certain plants will need some assistance, which may only be misting.</dl>
            <dt><u>10%-40%</u></dt>
            <dl>Below 40% is becoming very dry and is likely to be the levels indoors when central and artificial heating is being used. Your cacti and succulents will be fine but the majority of plants are going to have leaf and flower problems.</dl>
